# Viewing PDF-Files in xpdf

## 1) Introduction
When the widespread use of graphical terminals became common in the early 1990s, portability issues began to emerge. Documents created on a specific computer were not necessarily portable to other platforms. Here, portability means that the layout intended by the author might not display correctly on another user's system. As long as people used simple .txt files on text-based terminals, this wasn't a problem. However, graphical shells allowed images and complex layouts, introducing significant customization—and with it, compatibility—problems.

Adobe addressed these compatibility issues by developing a file format designed to preserve document fidelity across platforms. They named it the Portable Document Format, or PDF for short. PDFs provided three key features that ensured consistent renderings without drastically inflating file sizes:

Embedding graphics and fonts directly within the document.

Offering cross-platform reader software—initially Adobe Acrobat.

Allowing document protection against unauthorized modification.

Adobe Acrobat, the original PDF creation and viewing software, was developed using C++ and was commercially distributed by Adobe. To facilitate wider adoption and ensure that PDFs could be easily accessed by everyone, Adobe later released a free variant named Adobe Acrobat Reader.

On Linux systems, a powerful yet simple open-source alternative to Adobe Acrobat Reader emerged: xpdf. This lightweight PDF viewer provides a reliable and efficient way to read PDF documents directly from the Linux command line or graphical desktop environment. In this section, you'll learn how to utilize xpdf to seamlessly display, navigate, and manage PDF documents within Linux.

## 2) Tasks
1. **Check DISPLAY Variable**: Open your terminal and verify if your `DISPLAY` variable is set correctly. Run `printenv` or `echo $DISPLAY` for that.
2. **Test Connection with xeyes**: Use the `xeyes` program from the x11-apps toolkit to test your X11 server connection.
3. **Install xpdf**: Use your preferred package manager to install the `xpdf` package or compile it from source.
4. **Display a PDF File**: Use `xpdf <filename>.pdf` to open and view a PDF document. If you don't have a PDF file at hand, you can download a simple one from [here](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf). To download a file into your `~`-directory, use `wget https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf`.
5. **Use poppler-utils**: Use the `pdftotext <filename>.pdf` command from the `poppler-utils` package to convert a PDF to text.

## 3) Questions
1. Which command displays all environment variables?
2. How can you filter and display specific environment variables using command-line tools?
3. Which command would you use to show the value of a single environment variable?
4. What content does your `DISPLAY` variable currently hold?
5. Describe what happens when a user-program displays something using the X11 protocol.
6. What output do you get when running `xpdf --version`?
7. What happens when running `xpdf -z 8`?
8. Compare the outputs of `xpdf -z 50` and `xpdf -z 150`.
9. What is the effect of running `xpdf -rv`?
10. Explain what the command `pdftotext <filename>` does.

## 4) Advice
When working with PDFs on the command line using tools like `xpdf` and `poppler-utils`, always familiarize yourself with the available command-line options by using the `--help` option (e.g., `xpdf --help`). Mastering these commands will greatly enhance your efficiency in managing and processing PDF documents directly from your terminal.
